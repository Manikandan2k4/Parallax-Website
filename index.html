      <p class="text">
        Adventure trips are all about making memories, gaining more knowledge, learning new things about the surroundings and about ones own self and making lots of great stories. Going for an adventure camp is the best way to get all of these as it forces one to get out of their ordinary lives and try new things.
        <br> <br>
        Adventure in many ways has been proven beneficial for us. Surmounting a challenge during an adventure is a brilliant way to leave us feeling positive about ourselves & thus has a positive impact on our mental health. Sometimes, it can also help us have a deeper insight about ourselves. This happens when we let ourselves loose in an unfamiliar situation. It can let our hidden strengths unveil and make us push our limits.

          <P class="text">
            Paragliding is an exhilarating and adventurous air sport that involves flying lightweight, foot-launched gliders. Participants, known as paragliders, are suspended beneath a fabric wing, soaring through the air with the help of wind currents. This activity combines the thrill of free-flight with the serenity of gliding, providing a unique perspective of the landscape below. 
            <br> <br>
            Paragliders often take off from elevated locations such as hills or cliffs, and once in the air, they can navigate by shifting their weight and manipulating the lines attached to the glider. The simplicity of the equipment makes paragliding accessible to a wide range of enthusiasts, from beginners enjoying tandem flights with experienced pilots to seasoned solo pilots seeking the freedom of unpowered flight.
